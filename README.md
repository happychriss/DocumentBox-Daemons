DocumentBox is a OpenSource „home use“ Document Management system that helps you to
easy scan, file and find your documents. Its running on a mini computer
as small as a Raspberry Pi 3. A scanner connected to the mini-computers
allows you to quickly scan your documents and file them directly from
your mobile phone or tablet.
